![](https://i.ibb.co/ncJ1H6Z/65f4a1dd9c51265f49d0.png)

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project involves building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization, and implementing a file storage engine.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a command interpreter that allows users to:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place)
- Retrieve objects from a file or database
- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Installation

```
   git clone https://github.com/mirr-x/AirBnB_clone.git
```
```
   cd AirBnB_clone
```
```
   ./console.py
```
